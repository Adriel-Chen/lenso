Example
=======

In this example we take a [`models.json`](models.json) file, generate structs and lenses based on it, and append some [code for manual testing](suffix.swift) to create a [playground](example.playground/Contents.swift).

Open the playground in Xcode, scroll to the bottom, and check things out!

To use your own models, edit [`models.json`](models.json), run `./generate`, and open the playground again.

Enjoy! :sparkles:
